         <p> This foundation was originally created to offer scholarships to inspire children in Dolly's home town to achieve educational success. The focus was to lower dop out rates in the early 90s so Dolly promised every 7th and 8th grader she would personally gift them 500 dollars if they graduated highschool in her home county. This program helped lower the drop out rate from 35% to 6%. The Dolly foundation has also offered five $15,000 scholarships to senior students who successfully communicated their plan to realize their dreams.</p>
